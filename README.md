# ARK Retouch (Legacy)
This Android app is a quick and simple graphical editor.

The codebase is forked from editor module of "Simple Gallery" app:\
https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Gallery

## You can download the APK from GitHub Actions

Each commit triggers a build process, but artifacts do expire after 2 months.\
If you see a commit in last 2 months, go to GitHub Actions section of the project\
and download fresh build from the latest CI job.

## Make sure to grant the app "Files and Media" permission

The app won't ask for it... We have certain amount of bug in this app.\
That's why we are working on brand new implementation:\
